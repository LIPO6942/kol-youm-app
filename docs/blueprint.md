## Core Features:

- Intelligent Outfit Suggestion: Generate personalized outfit suggestions based on user's schedule keywords, weather, selected occasion, and preferred color palette. The LLM acts as a tool, using these inputs to determine suitable clothing combinations.
- Style Assembler: Allow users to visually select a piece of clothing from their wardrobe and display 3 matching outfit suggestions.
